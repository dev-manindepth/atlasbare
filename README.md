# Atlas Wealth

Atlas Wealth is a mobile app for real estate investment banking and wealth management. The idea
is simple: bring curated, property-backed investment opportunities, a clear view of our portfolio,
and the advisory tools we'd actually want to use into one calm, trustworthy place.

This repository is the React Native build of the app, targeting iOS first.

## Motivation

Most of us never get a single, honest view of where our money sits in real estate, how it's
performing, and what we could do next. We're building Atlas Wealth to close that gap. As we move
through the project we'll keep this README updated so that anyone reading it can follow along and
understand not just what the app does, but why each piece is there.

## What we're building

We're adding this incrementally, so treat the list below as the direction we're heading rather than
a finished feature set:

- Browse curated real estate investment opportunities (funds, REITs, individual properties).
- A portfolio dashboard with holdings, allocation, and performance over time.
- Property detail views with financials, location, and documents.
- Secure sign-in with biometric unlock.
- Committing and managing capital through guided, validated flows.
- Offline access to the things we look at most, with changes that sync when we're back online.
- An assistant that can explain our portfolio and summarize deal documents in plain language.

## Tech stack

- React Native (CLI)
- TypeScript
- iOS as the first target platform

We'll note new libraries here as we introduce them, so the stack section grows alongside the app.

## Getting started

We'll need Node, Xcode, and CocoaPods set up first.

```bash
npm install

# install the iOS native dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# build and run on the iOS simulator
npm run ios
```

If the Metro bundler isn't already running, `npm start` will start it.

## Screenshots and media

We'll add screenshots and short clips here as each part of the app comes together, so this section
will fill out as we make progress. For now it's intentionally empty.

## Project status

Early days. We're building this feature by feature and keeping things clean as we go. If we're
reading this together, thanks for following along.
